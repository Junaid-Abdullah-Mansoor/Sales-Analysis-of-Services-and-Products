# Sales Analysis of Services and Products

This Python project focuses on performing a complex sales analysis of services and products sold, using two CSV files: `SouthlakeServices.csv` and `SouthlakeProducts.csv`. The goal is to understand why some stores perform better than others by addressing various questions related to sales volume, pricing variation, services/products offered, average ticket pricing, return rate, and potential outliers.

## Project Tasks
The following tasks are performed as part of the sales analysis:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Ensure uniformity of data across the two CSV files, allowing for scalability to handle additional CSV files.
   - Remove records with empty fields.

2. Descriptive Statistics:
   - Print a summary of descriptive statistics for the sales data.
   - Generate histograms and visualizations of the sales data.
   - Calculate skewness and kurtosis.

3. Relationship Analysis:
   - Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between sales price and quantity sold.
   - Construct a histogram to show the breakdown of sales by category (services and products).

4. Top/Bottom Selling Services and Products:
   - Identify the top 10 best-selling services and the top 100 best-selling products based on sales revenue.
   - Determine the 10 worst-selling services and the 100 worst-selling products.

5. Categorical Feature Analysis:
   - Explore the relationship between categorical features if applicable.
   - Analyze the correlation between quantity sold and revenue.

6. Correlation Analysis:
   - Generate a correlation matrix to examine the correlation between different sales data attributes.

7. Outlier Detection:
   - Identify outliers within the sales data using standard deviation.

8. Product Elimination Analysis:
   - Utilize decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms to perform a product elimination analysis for services and products.
   - Utilize KMeans clustering to identify services and products that can potentially be eliminated.

9. Sales Focus Analysis:
   - Apply machine learning or other appropriate techniques to determine services and products that should be prioritized for boosting or elimination.

10. Returned Orders Analysis:
    - Analyze returned orders per product/service, considering negative values or those listed in parentheses indicating refund amounts.

11. Additional Code:
    - Implement any other relevant code or analysis techniques to enhance the sales analysis.

## Conclusion
The Sales Analysis of Services and Products project utilizes Python to analyze sales data from the `SouthlakeServices.csv` and `SouthlakeProducts.csv` files. By performing various data preprocessing steps, descriptive statistics, visualizations, correlation analysis, outlier detection, and machine learning models, insights can be gained regarding sales performance, identifying top-selling and bottom-selling items, exploring relationships, and making informed decisions on product and service focus.
